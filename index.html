            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transformation of Education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                prabhu. Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India
                from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in
                modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges,
                and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila,
                in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system
                of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano
                -Páli language.
                
                Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted
                a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc.
                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.</p>

                <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's Grow Together</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Beginning in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education
                    systems throughout the world, affecting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries. Closures
                    of schools and other learning spaces have impacted 94 percent of the world's student population, up to
                    99 percent in low and lower-middle income countries.Many schools made alternative plans during the
                    pandemic, leading to a variety of in-person, hybrid, and online-only plans, which led to challenges for
                many students, teachers, and families including children with learning disabilities and those learning
                in a language that is not their native one.As of September 30, 2020 there were 27 countries that had
                localized school closures. In the United States, an estimated 55.1 million students were forced to cease
                in-person instruction as of April 10, 2020. A switch to a virtual learning experience is particularly
                challenging for families that cannot afford the proper technology, such as laptops, printers, or a
                reliable Internet connection. When schools close, parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of
                children at home and can struggle to perform this task. This is especially true for parents with limited
                education and resources. </p>
